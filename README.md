# HappyDocker

**Read-only Docker image update and vulnerability monitoring.**

HappyDocker is a .NET 10 tool with a working read-only Docker inventory CLI. Image update checks and vulnerability monitoring are planned. It **does not** automatically update or restart production containers.

## Goals

- Inventory running containers and the exact image references/digests deployed.
- Detect changes to mutable image tags and discover plausible newer version tags where supported.
- Scan image contents for known vulnerabilities using an established scanner rather than maintaining a CVE database.
- Distinguish an affected package from a demonstrated exploitable application path.
- Send useful, deduplicated notifications through ntfy.
- Start on one Docker host and expand to multiple hosts after the single-host workflow is reliable.

## Current status

Implemented:

- `scan` lists running containers, their original configured image references, immutable image IDs, platforms, and repository digests where available.
- Image-reference parsing supports Docker Hub defaults (`ubuntu` → `docker.io/library/ubuntu:latest`), namespace-qualified names, GHCR, explicit registry hosts and ports (including localhost and bracketed IPv6), tags, and digest pins.
- References retain the original configured text alongside normalized registry, repository, tag, and digest fields. A digest pin does not acquire an implicit `latest` tag; an explicitly configured tag alongside a digest is preserved.
- Classification separates registry-backed references, ambiguous names, content IDs, invalid references, and missing references. Explicit registry names and named digest pins identify a registry target; matching repository-digest metadata can also identify an unqualified name. This does not verify remote existence or prove that an image was pulled.
- Unqualified names normalize using Docker naming rules but remain ambiguous without matching metadata: a name such as `team/app:dev` could be a local tag. Missing repository digests alone do not prove a local build. Content IDs identify no configured registry repository; unrelated repository digests are never used to guess one.
- Missing image metadata is reported as unknown. Conflicting duplicate image inspection records are rejected with a diagnostic. Partial image-inspection failures still produce an inventory from available metadata and retain Docker's nonzero exit code.
- Unit tests cover parsing, normalization, classification, metadata handling, and scan commands/output using fixtures, without a Docker daemon.

No registry network requests, update comparisons, vulnerability scanning, persistence, or notifications are implemented.

### Run locally

Install the .NET 10 SDK and Docker CLI, and ensure the local Docker daemon is accessible:

```sh
dotnet run --project src/HappyDocker -- scan
```

The scan invokes only `docker ps`, `docker inspect --type container`, and `docker image inspect`. The report keeps the configured reference and image ID columns, followed by repository digests, normalized reference, classification, and its reason. It never pulls images or changes Docker state.

```sh
dotnet test HappyDocker.slnx
```

Naming follows the [Docker distribution reference rules](https://github.com/distribution/reference). Digest validation currently supports lowercase hexadecimal SHA-256, SHA-384, and SHA-512 with their exact encoded lengths. Unsupported algorithms and malformed references are reported as invalid without interrupting the inventory.

See [the project plan](docs/PLAN.md) for scope, milestones, design constraints, and open questions.

## Initial technology choices

- **Runtime:** C# / .NET 10
- **Interface:** Local read-only console report; JSON output planned
- **State:** SQLite when change tracking is introduced
- **Notifications:** ntfy
- **Security scanning:** Existing scanner (Trivy or equivalent), with exact digest/version reported
- **Registries:** Docker Hub and GitHub Container Registry (GHCR) first

## Safety principles

1. **Never auto-update, pull over, restart, or delete running containers.**
2. Docker Engine access is privileged: do not assume a `:ro` Docker socket mount is read-only API access.
3. Favor least privilege and avoid exposing the Docker API over the network.
4. Do not leak registry credentials, image-auth headers, or internal metadata in logs or notifications.
5. Report uncertainty clearly: finding a vulnerable package is not proof that the workload exposes the vulnerable function.
